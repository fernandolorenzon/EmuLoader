You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun."

Each time the character attacks his or her super meter is charged up, to a maximum of three levels. Whenever the super meter has at least one level charged the character can use his or her super attacks, which drain one level of the meter in the process. If the meter is allowed to charge up to the maximum three levels without being used all of the character's attacks become more powerful."

This was proven to be false. However, the game can be readily found for $100 - $200, so for those who may have fond memories of the gameplay and/or wish to add it to their library of games, they can obtain it rather easily.

Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the &quot;charge meter&quot;, which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. &quot;Charge moves&quot; are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The characters and stages are inspired by the Double Dragon movie featured prominently in the game's intro. This includes the appearances of a submerged Hollywood, the Dragon Mobile vehicle, Billy and Jimmy's ability to transform themselves and the inclusion of Koga Shuko as the game's final boss. However, the game's characters are depicted in a more anime-like style and only six of the game's twelve fighters are actually featured in the movie; Burnov and Duke are from previous Double Dragon games and rest were created specifically for this game.

Players are depicted as humans wielding large shields rather than the &quot;paddles&quot; alone. The setting consists of various futuristic arenas; the game takes place in the first half of the 22nd century. The ball cannot leave the play area upon reaching the left or right edge of the screen, as those are also limited by walls, in addition to the typical upper and lower wall. Instead, there are single columns of targets located along both the side walls. Whenever the ball hits a target, it is eliminated and points are scored by the opponent of the targets' owner. In order to win a round, the player must direct the ball by deflecting it with his/her shield so that all of his opponents' targets are eliminated while retaining at least one of his own targets. The duration of rounds is also limited by time; in the event that time expires before one of the sides manages to achieve victory, the side with the most targets left in play is declared the winner of the round; should this result in a draw (when both players have an equal amount of targets left), both sides are awarded a win."

It's a maze, of sorts, and it's one hell of an irritating game. In fact, it is one of the most irritating games that most will ever come across. But it does have its charms, namely its offbeat gameplay.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The graphics are bright and colorful, with a lot of eye candy everywhere. Depending on your point of view, this may or may not be a good thing, as all that coloring and eye candy has been designed specifically to distract you from beating the level. All that glitter is isolated to the areas immediately surrounding the track, and if you look off the beaten path you'll notice that the graphics there are quite sparse and simplistic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The sound and music are passable, though not particularly good. The Irritating Maze's songs sound like generic puzzle game music and are generally pretty forgettable, but they do fit the game's mood. You'll hear an announcer's voice at certain points of the game telling you that you've passed a checkpoint or something like that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The announcer sounds reasonably excited, though if you listen you can hear a little bit of electronic fuzz distorting the voice clips. One sound clip stands out above the rest though, and that's the electric zap effect that plays when you lose. When this clip is combined with the associated graphics, the effect is literally shocking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the biggest reasons why the game is so irritating is that you have to control your character's conducting rod with a trackball. For most people, the trackball is not an ideal input device for precise control, especially when put under the stress of time limits. A digital joystick or D-pad would actually allow you to have more precise control, but then having to deal with unfamiliar controls is part of the &quot;fun.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At first you'll find the innovative gameplay to be a lot of fun, much like Marble Madness. But unlike Marble Madness, The Irritating Maze's gameplay gets old relatively quickly, and you'll find yourself not caring enough to give the level another go. The Irritating Maze is different enough to be entertaining for a couple of minutes but not quite polished enough to be a lot of fun for the long haul. Give it a quarter or two and see how you do."

Several characters from Rage of The Dragons also make a cross-over to the game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In  Matrimelee, the staple super combo gauge is replaced with the &quot;Stress Gauge&quot;. Unlike most combo gauges, the Street Gauge doesn't fill when players connect with attacks. Instead it fills when attacks are blocked and when damage is taken. This is to simulate the &quot;stress&quot; of not having your moves land, and/or the stress one may feel when punched in the face.  When the Stress Gauge fills up, a super combo can be performed. Characters also become invulnerable to attacks and will also interrupt combos.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some stages, a referee will be standing in the background. Players can actually call him into the foreground and use him to attack their enemies... either sending the ref flying into the opponent, or using him as a human shield for opponent's projectiles.  A &quot;Bloodline Battle&quot; can also be initiated if two players taunt one after the other. When a Bloodline Battle begins, both characters move to the middle of the screen.

Coins of the same denomination can be chained to convert them to coins of higher value; for example, if you place two 5 yen coins next to each other they will become a 10 yen coin, while 5 10 yen coins will convert to a 50 yen coin. This pattern continues up to 500 yen coins; two five-hundred yen coins placed next to each other will disappear, helping to clear the player's side and pushing down the coins on the opponent's side.

With superior numbers and equipment, the Rebellion overwhelms the unsuspecting Regular Army troops easily. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The attacks could have been countered effectively, or even prevented, should the high-ranking officials have listened to the Regular Army's intelligence community, which had been warning about all sorts of indications that the Rebellion could attack at any moment in decisive force. Unfortunately, the same officials decide to save their own skins and announce that it was the intelligence failure that led to such catastrophe, which the personnel serving in the intelligence community did not appreciate whatsoever. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Meanwhile, Regular Army is pushed to near annihilation, with cities that it was suppose to be protecting in ruins. General Morden makes an announcement that all of the major cities around the world will be under his control within 170 hours, also adding that any resistance would be futile. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The announcement certainly did not discourage a band of Regular Army soldiers attempt to salvage whatever they had left. Shortly after, a group named &quot;Resistants&quot; are formed by surviving members of the Regular Army and its researchers, who began to covertly convert the Metal Slug tank prototypes into combat-ready status in a hidden factory, hoping to launch a counter-offensive to regain what they had lost to the Rebellion. Morden just as quickly learns of this fact and attacks the plant, crushing the Resistants and capturing the tanks, putting an end to the counterattack even before it could begin. The vehicles are then scattered to prevent any ragtag Regular Army troops reclaiming them and using them to launch attacks. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Seeing the Regular Army panic and crumble, 1st Lieutenant Marco Rossi of the Regular Army Peregrine Falcons special forces unit quickly unites remaining Regular Army units and begins a commando operation to reclaim the tanks. Fighting alongside him is Second Lieutenant Tarma Roving from the same unit. Their main objectives were to engage the Rebellion and neutralize its leader, General Morden, while reclaiming the Metal Slug tanks to aid them in battles. If the tanks could not be recaptured, then they would have to destroy them to prevent them from being used by the Rebellion. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The player has to constantly shoot at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of a level. At the end of each level, the player might confront a boss who is often considerably larger than regular enemies and takes many shots to defeat. On the way through the level, the player finds weapons upgrades and &quot;Metal Slug&quot; tanks that can be used not only as weapons but also as added defense.&#xD;&#xA;The protagonists can perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die for simply coming into contact with most enemies. Correspondingly, many of the enemy troops have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is destructible. Sometimes this reveals extra items or powerups, most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the course of a level, the player encounters prisoners of war. If they are freed, the player can receive bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. The player receives a score bonus for freeing POWs at the end of the level; at this point the game shows the name and rank for each of the prisoners freed. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs is restarted.&#xD;&#xA;There are a total of six levels, with themes ranging from forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases."

Lo and behold, Data East had the audacity to make a sequel a year after the release of the original, even after Capcom tried to sue them for ripping off SF2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fighter's History Dynamite (also known as Karnov's Revenge) is at least an improvement over the original. The sequel adds playable bosses (Clown and Karnov) and two new characters: Zazie &amp; Yungmie. Besides a better selection of playable characters and some new backgrounds, the game itself really hasn't changed very much in terms of looks or gameplay.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While playing Karnov's Revenge, there's just no way to shake the feeling that this game is trying to be Street Fighter 2 with a different cast of characters. For the second time around, it doesn't offer any true innovation to the fighting game genre. Although, you could unlock a special fight against a bull if you beat the game without losing a single round, but who the hell would want to play this game for that long?"
